## 🚨 Important Notes

### File Uploads on Vercel
⚠️ **Vercel's serverless functions use `/tmp` storage (temporary)**

For production file uploads, integrate:
- **Cloudinary** (recommended for images)
- **Vercel Blob** (Vercel's storage solution)
- **AWS S3** (enterprise solution)

Current local uploads will work for testing but files won't persist.

### MongoDB Atlas Required
- Vercel serverless functions need a cloud database
- MongoDB Atlas free tier is perfect
- Set IP whitelist to `0.0.0.0/0` (allow all)

---

## 📊 Monitoring

View real-time logs:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
vercel logs --follow
```

Or check in Vercel Dashboard → Functions

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Deployment fails?
1. Check **Deployments** → Click failed deployment
2. View **Building** and **Functions** logs
3. Common fix: `npm run build` locally first

### API not working?
1. Verify `MONGODB_URI` in Vercel env vars
2. Check MongoDB IP whitelist
3. View function logs

### Routes not working?
1. Ensure `vercel.json` exists
2. Check `api/index.js` exists
3. Redeploy
